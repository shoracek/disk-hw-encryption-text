\section{Thesis description}


 The thesis aims to analyze existing approaches to using hardware-encrypted block devices (disks) in Linux and propose integrating such devices into the cryptsetup project.

The implementation should use the Linux kernel interface.

Student should
\begin{itemize}
    \item get familiar with and study available resources for self-encrypted drives, OPAL2 standard, block layer inline encryption,
    \item analyze and describe security of such drives,
    \item provide state-of-the-art overview of existing attacks,
    \item implement proof-of-concept extension to cryptsetup project (and possibly propose changes for Linux kernel).
\end{itemize}

The student should be familiar with C code for low-level system programming and cryptography concepts. 

\chapter{Hardware disk encryption}

\emph{Hardware disk encryption} is a technology that provides confidentiality of data stored on a storage device using encryption provided by hardware.

Some general overview about what it is, I guess., maybe talk about both sw and hw enc instead

Describe generic stuff: provisioning, locking, key types DEK, KEK, MEK, processes, locking ranges vs. FDE, ... keyslots?,,, (and for opal TPer, SP, ..)

mention LUKS somewhere...

The disk encryption process can be conducted in logically and physically different places, depending on the type. In the following sections of this chapter, we will further describe three such types.

\section{Self-encrypting drives}

at least try to mention ATA security,,, which means also mentioning opal,,,, and TCG Enterprise...

\section{Inline encryption hardware}

Compared to the previously described self-encrypting drives, inline encryption hardware is separated from the disk, and 

something about how it provides actually a way to check the encrypted content, right?

\section{Software encryption}

probably just a quick overview, ... maybe change the chapter to just "disk encryption"... or mention this just shortly at the start...

\subsection{Linux stack}

rethink where to put this... maybe tools?

\paragraph{dm-crypt}

\paragraph{fscrypt}

\chapter{fscrypt}

Assuming ext4 in this chapter...

\section{How to make it work?}

As of now, blk-layer inline encryption is supported only by two filesystems in Linux: ext4 and F2FS.
Need to use a kernel with \verb|CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION_INLINE_CRYPT| enabled.
Need to first mount the filesystem with the inline encryption flag:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mount -t ext4 /dev/foo /mnt/foo -o inlinecrypt
\end{lstlisting}
It is not enough to specify the inline encryption flag, the encryption itself also must be enabled. Assuming ext4 filesystem, the encryption can be enabled after mounting like so:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
tune2fs -O encrypt "/dev/loop0"
\end{lstlisting}
After this, \verb|fscrypt| can be used as normal and it will use inline encryption for this filesystem. 

In order to encrypt a folder using a \verb|fscrypt|, the following must be done: an encryption key must be added and the encryption policy must be created.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
int fd = open(pathname, O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC);

struct fscrypt_add_key_arg *key_request = calloc(1, sizeof(struct fscrypt_add_key_arg) + key_len);
struct fscrypt_policy_v2 policy_request = { 0 };

// add a key
key_request->key_spec.type = FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_IDENTIFIER;
key_request->key_id = 0;
key_request->raw_size = key_len;
memcpy(key_request->raw, key, key_len);
ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY, key_request);

// set a policy
policy_request.version = 2;
policy_request.contents_encryption_mode = FSCRYPT_MODE_AES_256_XTS;
policy_request.filenames_encryption_mode = FSCRYPT_MODE_AES_256_CTS;
policy_request.flags = FSCRYPT_POLICY_FLAGS_PAD_8 | FSCRYPT_POLICY_FLAGS_PAD_16 | FSCRYPT_POLICY_FLAGS_PAD_32;
memcpy(policy_request.master_key_identifier, key_request->key_spec.u.identifier, FSCRYPT_KEY_IDENTIFIER_SIZE);
ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY, &policy_request);
\end{lstlisting}

This code sets up an encryption policy for the file specified by the pathname. 

\section{How does it work?}

\subsection{Setup}

During mounting the ``inlinecrypt''/\verb|SB_INLINECRYPT|  flag is written into the \verb|super_block| structure.

It all starts in \verb|__ext4_new_inode|. This is the internal function used when creating new inodes, called by functions such as \verb|ext4_create| when creating a new file.

The function (if it is not inode used for large extended attributes?) calls \verb|fscrypt_prepare_new_inode|.

\verb|fscrypt_prepare_new_inode -> fscrypt_setup_encryption_info ->| \verb|setup_file_encryption_key ->  fscrypt_select_encryption_impl|

In \verb|fscrypt_select_encryption_impl| there is actually the only place where the \verb|SB_INLINECRYPT| flag is used.
... Calls \verb|blk_crypto_config_supported| to check the device's crypto profile.
Afterwards, \verb|fscrypt_select_encryption_impl| function sets the \verb|(fscrypt_info *)ci->ci_inlinecrypt|.

\verb|setup_per_mode_enc_key| then sets the \verb|(fscrypt_info *)ci->ci_enc_key|.

\subsection{Usage}

The bio function is stored in \\ \verb|(struct bio *)bio->(struct bio_crypt_ctx *)bi_crypt_context|

Function \verb|fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx| changes the file's bio to use inline encryption... simply calls the blk layer \verb|bio_crypt_set_ctx|.

Calling \verb|submit_bio| like normally ... \verb|__submit_bio| calls \verb|__blk_crypto_bio_prep|...

\blockquote{If the bio crypt context provided for the bio is supported by the underlying device's inline encryption hardware, do nothing.}

\verb|__blk_crypto_rq_bio_prep| however sets the context of the request to the one of the bio... 
After the bio prep  \verb|blk_mq_submit_bio| gets called (which calls \verb|blk_mq_bio_to_request|, and after that also \verb|blk_crypto_init_request->blk_crypto_get_keyslot| which updates the devices keyslot to contain the new key..., but does nothing if the device does not have keyslots)..... the info about the key to use then has to be acquired by the driver from \verb|request->|


Most important are probably structures \verb|blk_crypto_ll_ops| and \verb|blk_crypto_profile|... just two operations, program key and evict key. 



how to get crypto profile from outside..




Where does the hardware come to play?

\verb|ufshcd_exec_raw_upiu_cmd()->ufshcd_issue_devman_upiu_cmd()->ufshcd_prepare_req_desc_hdr()->ufshcd_prepare_req_desc_hdr_crypto()| sets the header with the correct keyslot.

\chapter{TCG Opal 2.0}

TCG Opal SSC (Security Subsystem Class) 2.0 is a specification for storage devices, aiming to provide confidentiality of stored data while the disk implementing this specification is turned off~\cite{tcg-opal2}. The Opal standard is one of the representants of the self-encrypting drive approach to hardware disk encryption.


developed by TCG (Trusted Computing Group)

maybe move under the SED chapter, but it is probably going to be too big for that..., and important


structure of the standards described in \url{https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCGandNVMe_Joint_White_Paper-TCG_Storage_Opal_and_NVMe_FINAL.pdf}.



\section{Technical stuff}

I expect stuff here like important headers, codes, ...

\subsection{Capability discovery discovery}


begin with Level 0 discovery: \parencite[3.3.6]{tcg-storage-core} specifies the general security receives command for all TCG storage devices \cite[3.1.1]{tcg-opal2} specifies the Opal 2 specific parts of the header.

\subsection{setup}
\subsection{set locking range}
\subsection{access...}
\subsection{...}


\section{Comparison with OPAL 1.0}

OPAL 2 disks are \emph{optionally} backwards compatible.

\section{Comparision with other TCG's SSC}

Enterprise, Opalite, Pyrite, Ruby

\chapter{Existing tools}

\section{Cryptsetup}

... tool for disk encryption setup.

nothing for opal, right?

\section{sedutil}

supports opal, but the code seems to be abandoned

\chapter{Security of hardware encryption}

specify threat model, ,....,,, offline, online,,, offline multiple times???s

.. maybe change position of this chapter, since it's splitting tools and change to a tool

\section{Attacks on hardware encryption}

\chapter{OPAL extension for cryptsetup}
